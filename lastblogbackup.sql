While the update is a blessing to some, most people cannot update due to stringent minimum requirements.\r\n## Minimum Requirements\r\n\r\n- 4GB RAM\r\n- 64GB Storage\r\n- \\>= 8th Gen Intel or 2nd Gen Ryzen Processor\r\n- \\>= TPM 1.3 (TPM 2.0 Recommended)\r\n- UEFI BIOS\r\n- Capable of Secure Boot (But doesn\'t have to be enabled)\r\n\r\n### 1. Clean UI\r\n\r\nWhile Windows 10 had a UI that looked very dated compared to Mac OS, the new UI centers the taskbar and changes many important aspects of the OS. All of the icons are rejuvenated with new 2021 looks. Also, the corners of all the windows are rounded and many parts of the UI have been remade.\r\n\r\n### 2. Android App Support\r\n\r\nThat’s right, the new windows store will have the amazon store baked in, so you can install android apps natively. **However, this feature is not out in the developer versions of the operating system yet.**\r\n\r\n### 3. Snap Windows\r\n\r\nWindows 11 has a feature where you can snap different windows to any size and location you want them. It has lots of preset layouts, which you can use to increase your productivity. \r\n\r\n### 4. New Settings App\r\n\r\nWhile the new settings app has the same functions and features as before, the UI has changed a lot. Each section of the app is rounded and there are a variety of different colors. The new app looks more like the gnome app than previous windows ones.\r\n\r\n### 5. New Logo\r\n\r\nThe Windows logo has changed and now is symmetrical. \r\n\r\n### 6. New Login Screen\r\n\r\nThe login screen brings the rounded aspects of the rest of the UI. \r\n\r\n### 7. New File Explorer\r\n\r\nWhile the functions of the Windows 11 file explorer are the same as Windows 10, it has been decluttered and looks overall nicer. For example, instead of text, each function is represented by an icon. This leads to a more minimal experience while having the same functions.\r\n\r\n### 8. Gaming Features\r\n\r\nThere are multiple gaming features in Windows 11, including Auto HDR (which makes games look better with lighting) and direct storage (which makes games load faster). Each of these features will improve performance and visual quality for existing games. **None of these features have been rolled out yet.**\r\n\r\n### 9. And More...\r\n\r\nWhile we would love to give insights on every Windows 11 feature, we wouldn’t be able to fit every feature in this article. The best way to experience Windows is to get it yourself. \r\n','Satvik Agarwal','Tuesday, July 6th 2021',2),('Is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate worth it in 2021?','<html>\r\n<body>\r\n    <h2>Overview</h2>\r\n    <p>Here\'s the short answer: Yes! The great amount of games plus the access to play on the go whether its with touch or on controller, is a great value for just 15 dollars per month.</p>\r\n    <h2>A Bit of History</h2>\r\n    <p>Let me go through some light history, a couple years ago Microsoft released <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Game Pass</a> which has hundreds of really fun games. This was perfect for people who game on computer since they didn\'t need Xbox Live Gold to play online, however for console, you needed <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/gold\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Live Gold</a> to play with your friends and enjoy many of the games to their fullest extent. This is when Microsoft released Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which included Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold for only 15 dollars. Just a couple weeks ago, Microsoft released <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/cloud-gaming\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> which comes free with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>\r\n    <h2>Xbox Game Pass & EA Play</h2>\r\n    <p>Xbox Game Pass has a enormous library! You can immerse yourself in 4k racing games like the soon to come, <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/forza-horizon-5\" target=\"_blank\">Forza Horizon 5,</a> to exciting shooter games like the new <a href=\"https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/games/halo-infinite\" target=\"_blank\">Halo Infinite,<a> about to come in a couple of months! While these are just a couple of the best games to come to <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Game Pass</a>! In addition to all of those games on Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Game Pass also includes <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/ea-play\" target=\"_blank\">EA Play</a>, with many of the EA games such as <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/battlefront/star-wars-battlefront-2\" target=\"_blank\">Battlefront 2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/fifa-21\" target=\"_blank\">FIFA 21</a> <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-21\" target=\"_blank\">Madden 21</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/titanfall/titanfall-2\" target=\"_blank\">Titanfall 2</a>, basically all of the <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed\" target=\"_blank\">Need for Speeds</a>, and maybe even <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042\" target=\"_blank\">Battle Field 2042</a> once it comes out! That\'s just a few games of their extensive collection of huge variety!</p>\r\n    <h2>Xbox Cloud Gaming</h2>\r\n    <p>Xbox Cloud Gaming has so far gotten off to a good start. With all Game Pass games included in Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can try out games you don\'t want to install or play on the go. Just recently they released a way to play on every device, just by going <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> on almost every device. While it is all great, the only problem I got when using it was input lag, which will improve significantly in the future.<p>\r\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n    <p>Look at all of what is offered in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, I can say firmly that it is a great value to buy it. On top of all of that, Microsoft is offering discounts every so often, such as <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass#join\" target=\"_blank\">1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for just 1 dollar</a>!</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>','Tarun P.','Tuesday, July 6th 2021',3),('The Epic Games v. Apple Court Case','Apple and Epic Games have been fighting a court case for nearly 11 months now, and the verdict is set to be revealed toward the end of this year. Both the plaintiff, Epic, and the defendant, Apple, have revealed some very compelling reasons as to whether or not Apple should be restrictive of app developers. However, one thing is for certain: this case will not only affect both Apple and Epic, but it will also redefine how software is distributed in this new digital era.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nAlthough Epic v. Apple is what this article mainly focuses on, it is very important to also bring up Epic v. Google, a similar case with one major difference.\r\n\r\n##### Epic v. Apple\r\n\r\nThrough its App Store, Apple has implemented a 30% revenue cut on in-app purchases, and they also block sideloaded apps and external app stores on iOS and iPadOS, forcing consumers to only buy from the App Store and forcing developers to only host on the App Store. To combat this loss in revenue, Epic added a direct payment option for Fortnite V-Bucks (the in-game currency), which, when clicked, would take the consumer to Epic\'s website, where they could buy the Battle Pass for 20% lower than through the App Store, as a result of bypassing Apple\'s tax.  Obviously, Apple didn\'t like this, and thus they removed Fortnite from the iOS app store. Just a few hours later, Epic Games sued Apple for anti-competitive behavior. In reaction, a few months later, Apple reduced the 30% tax to 15%, but only for developers that make under $1 million (USD).\r\n\r\n##### Epic v. Google\r\n\r\nGoogle also has similar rules for in-app purchases on their Play Store, however, unlike Apple, they allow for sideloaded apps on Android. Epic also sued Google around the same time as they sued Apple, and Google also removed Fortnite from their Play Store, although Fortnite could still be officially sideloaded using the Epic Games Store, available as an .apk file from Epic\'s Website.\r\n\r\n#### Positions Taken on Both Sides\r\n\r\n**Apple** continues to take the position that they reserve the right to implement taxes on in-app purchases, and claiming that they prevent side loading due to \"...high standards for privacy, security, content, and quality.\" Apple has also said that they do not regulate Progressive Web Apps, and thus they are offering an alternate option for developers other than the App Store.\r\n\r\n**Epic** continues to take the position that Apple is anti-competitive, claiming that they \"...\\[have\\] an absolute monopoly on the distribution of software, \\[and\\] on the monetization of software.\"\r\n\r\n#### Opinion\r\n\r\nAs we can see, both sides have made very compelling arguments, and now, I will state my opinion on this court case. Please keep in mind that this is not what I predict will happen, but rather my perspective on the court case.\r\n\r\n##### What Epic Did Right\r\n\r\nI believe that Epic was completely right to point out the massive monopoly that the App Store has on developers. By forcing app developers to use the App Store, and the App Store solely, Apple is removing alternatives for developers and forcing them to pay the 30% tax. Yes, developers could make PWAs, but web apps can be slower than apps that run natively, often making them not suitable for complex games or other forms of high-performance applications. Therefore, Apple is being anti-competitive due to its blocking of external app stores on iOS and iPadOS.\r\n\r\n##### What Apple Did Right\r\n\r\nI believe that Apple has every right to implement a 30% tax on in-app purchases. After all, the purchase is being done through Apple\'s payment platform, and the app is being hosted on Apple\'s App Store, both of which Apple actively develops, maintains, and owns. Therefore, it is only fair that Apple earns revenue through these platforms so that it can continue to maintain and develop them for app developers and consumers. Furthermore, a 30% revenue cut has been the industry standard for a while now, which I think further justifies Apple\'s behavior regarding revenue cuts.\r\n\r\n##### What Should Be Fixed\r\n\r\nApple should start allowing the sideloading of native apps on iOS and iPadOS. By allowing these apps, app developers can host their apps on their own platform, thus allowing them more freedom over the distribution of their software. As app developers would not be using Apple\'s services, they could bypass the revenue cut, and instead, they could offer their products to consumers at a cheaper price if they wished to do so.\r\n\r\nWhile Apple may argue that this could cause problems with security and privacy, I believe that this could be largely mitigated. Apple could [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)) sideloaded apps, preventing them from accessing files or other user information such as device identifiers that could compromise user privacy, only allowing the app to use the information it needs to operate. Furthermore, because these apps would run in an environment separate from the native one, even if the app was malware, it would not affect the other operations of the device or any information stored on it.\r\n\r\n#### Conclusion\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, both sides have made very valid points about how software should be distributed. On one hand, developers want freedom over the distribution of their applications, but on the other hand, consumers are increasingly wanting a more private and secure digital experience. Therefore, I believe that Apple should be allowed to implement a 30% revenue cut on their App Store. However, similar to Google, they should also allow apps to be sideloaded on their mobile platforms, albeit with restrictions that would allow for better security and privacy for users. This would allow for a fair compromise between freedom over software distribution, as well as the security and privacy of consumers using the software.\r\n','Kapilesh Pennichetty','Wednesday, July 7th 2021',4),('Welcome to TechDudes: An Introduction to Tech','### Introduction to TechDudes \r\n\r\nWelcome to the TechDudes Blog!
